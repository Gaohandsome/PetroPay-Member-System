the functions of plan to achieve
1. Automatic card type classification and upgrade 
   The card type is automatically determined based on the recharge amount: a recharge of ≥5,000 yuan qualifies for a gold card, ≥2,000 yuan for a silver card, and less than 2,000 yuan for a regular card. If a lower-level card (e.g., a silver card) is already held, recharging to meet the higher-level criteria (e.g., an additional 5,000 yuan) will automatically upgrade it to a gold card.

2. Differentiated consumption discount calculation
   Different discount rules are applied based on card types: gold card users enjoy a 20% discount, silver card users a 10% discount, and regular card users no discount. When consuming, the discounted amount is automatically calculated and deducted from the balance, with a simultaneous check on sufficient balance.

3. Exclusive car wash ticket offer for gold cards 
   When a gold card user's single consumption amount (after discount) is ≥200 yuan, the system automatically triggers a prompt for "giving a free car wash ticket," implementing the value-added service logic for gold card users.
